# An Awesome Idea

## Setup

1. Make sure you have [Volta](https://volta.sh) installed
2. Run `volta install pnpm`
3. Clone the project
4. Run `pnpm i`

_Why am I using pnpm?_ Mainly due to the fact that this is a much more memory efficient package manager (I currently have an M1 Pro Macbook Pro with 512GB) thus it helps me save some storage
